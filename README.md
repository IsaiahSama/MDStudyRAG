# MDStudyRag

This is MDStudyRag, a project developed by me, to take advantage of the fact that I do my notes in markdown (MD). The aim is to have an assistant program that will take the markdown, do any necessary pre-processing, then eventually use to RAG the Gemini model.

## Tools

To achieve the full extent of what I want, I'm going to need a series of tools.

### Markdown to Json

My input files will be in the form of markdown. For fine tuning purposes, I'd like to turn this into a JSON file in alpaca format.
