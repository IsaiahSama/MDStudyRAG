# Introduction to DBMS

## Data Vs Information

**Data** are a collection of raw facts, measurements or statitistics, often used as a foundation for reasoning, discussion or calculation to produce information.

**Information** is data that has been processed and changed into a meaningful and useful form for interpretation.
i.e: Information is data that has been contextualized via processess such as aggregation, manipulation and organization.

## From Traditional Files to Databases

**Manual File Systems** are generally made up of file folders, each labelled and kept in physical storage.

**Computerized File Systems** were introduced to better handle the increased volume of data and files.

### Problems with Traditional File Systems

- *Structural Dependence*
- *Data Dependence*
- *Data Redundancy*
- *Limited Data Sharing & Inadequate Security*
- *Not suitable for Ad Hoc Queries*
- *Excessive Program Maintenance*
- *Complex System administration*

## Databases

*Database* may have the following meanings:

1. A database is an organized collection of stored data.
2. A database is a shared collection of logically related data, designed to meet the information needs of multiple users in an organization.
3. A database is a shared, integrated computer structure that houses a collection of raw facts and metadata.
4. A database is a repository for stored data. It is *integrated* and *shared*.

The main definition we want to use is: A **database** is an organized and structured collection of data, composed of **fields**, **records** and **files**.

## Why databases?

With databases, the files are designed to meet the needs of the enterprise and all application programs.
